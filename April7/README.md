## Creating an Artwork Using OOP

**Introduction**

For this assignment, our professor asked us to create either an artwork or a game using Object Oriented Programming. In the 
end, I chose to create an artwork. This is like a 2.0 version of my previous assignment where I was inspired to recreate 
"Random Squares" by Herbert Franke. To improve it, I knew I had to create unique features while using object-oriented 
programming.

**Process**

For this assignment, I tried to think of several ideas to improve my previous assignment. One thing that was certain was 
to add more colors and probably shapes that get generated with certain properties. While reading some articles and books on
Computer Art from various authors, I saw a picture by Matt Pearson that looked like colorful bubbles floating around.
Overall, the picture was visually pleasant. I wondered if I could incorporate this with "Random Squares" and so I tried to
give it a go.

When the two ideas were incorporated, the results were pretty cool. The code allows for when the user clicks the mouse button,
circles will generate with little squares in the center of the circles. Rectangles also appear in the background from being
really small to becoming big then returning back to small. Moreover, when the user decides to spam the mouse button, you will
be able to see countless number of circles just floating around but I was curious to see how powerful my laptop is before the
whole thing just becomes really slow and laggy. Therefore, there is a code that displays the number of circles in the screen
in the console so that the user can know just how many circles are there in the screen before the whole screen gets populated
with circles of various colors. This was made possible by creating the class circles.

One thing I was curious to know was if it was possible to somehow have the circles count in the screen instead in the console 
for better viewing, but I did not really know how to do that.

**Images and Video**

You could watch my project for this assignment in this short [video](https://youtu.be/lrZ7XCzQ40s).

At the end of this video, there were 470 circles as shown in the console here:
