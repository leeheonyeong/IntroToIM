**Here is the description of my hands free switch**

This was my first assignment for the course Intro to Interactive Media. 
Our professor instructed us to make a switch without the use of our hands. 
The first idea that came up in my head was using my feet but using the feet alone would be too boring. 
Then, the idea of using drums struck me. By stepping on the pedal of the hi-hats, 
the two cymbals would touch and the LED would light up as each of the circuits (black and red) 
are taped using copper tape to each of the cymbals. 

Here is what the hi-hats looked like: ![](https://i.imgur.com/7gwj854.png)
