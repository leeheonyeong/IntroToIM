**Interactive Observation**

Something I find interactive on campus is the Siemens microwave I have in my suite. 
I interact with the microwave on a daily-basis as I use it for my oats every morning. 
The microwave has exactly 12 buttons and this cylindrical thing that you could turn 
to adjust the time you want to microwave your food. 

The first time I used this microwave, I was very confused with its lack of information 
on the labels of each button except for the “stop” and “start” buttons which I find very self-explanatory. 
The other 5 buttons are labeled with numbers such as 90, 180, 360, 600, and 800. 
The remaining 5 buttons are labeled with a single letter (eg. M, P) or container icons. 
I usually get it to work by turning the on switch and pressing the “800” button and the “start” button. 
Sometimes, I would play around with the buttons and the end result would be a cold cup of oats 
with only the edges of the container warm. From my experience, I believe the microwave could have 
been designed better so that a microwave novice like me can properly use the microwave as buttons, 
for example, labeled “P” do not really explain much.
