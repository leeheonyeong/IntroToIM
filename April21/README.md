## Trippy Electricity Sparks

**Introduction**

For this assignment, our professor asked us to experiment with Professor Aaron Sherwoodâ€™s example that he presented to us in
his guest lecture by making changes in his code and discover what we could create out of it. We were also told to write a 
description of our experiments and the results we have found, and try to explain why the changes we made resulted in what we
observed.

The lecture that Professor Sherwood gave contained a lot of fruitful information but I found it difficult to grasp all of them
in just one lecture alone. Therefore, I rewatched the lecture since our professor had it recorded. It was then that I started 
to play around with the Professor Sherwood's code.

**Process**

The first idea that came up in my mind was to tweak the code to have the rotater flash in random colors to make it look a bit 
trippy. I thought this idea would go really well since I also get to play around with the speed and the acceleration. For
example, if I were to have the rotaters move really fast and change colors along with it, it would like a color strobe light
effect (causes seizures to those who have photosensitive epilepsy). I also wanted to add a function for mousePressed which was 
to just slow down the acceleration so that everything comes to a halt.

The result reminded me of electricity sparks; therefore, I named the assignment "Trippy Electicity Sparks" as it also changes
the color of the rotaters really fast.

**Challenges and Conclusion**

There was no particular challenge that I faced in this assignment. Professor Sherwood's explanation was very straighforward 
which I found really convenient to work on. It was all just a matter of patience to understand the concepts he used.

Professor Sherwood must have had his own inspiration to create this really cool interactive art but what I also found really
cool was that how we could get inspired from other people's ideas and start to make something of our own with a little tweaks
that we chose to do.

This photo does not do much justice except to show what it initially looks like when you run the code so try watching the 
video or run the code by copy and pasting the code to Processing!
