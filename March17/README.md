## Making a Self Portrait Using Processing

**Introduction**

For our first processing homework, our professor asked us to make a self portrait created by our code. 
The requirements are listed below.

• The portrait must be entirely created by your code i.e. you must not interact with your computer while the 
portrait is being made (e.g. no drawing using the mouse)

• The portrait does not need to be dynamic (i.e. it does not need to change while we look at it) 

**Process**

The first thing I did was to set my background to a color of my liking - blue. Then, I set my board size big 
enough for me to work in which was (700,700). One important thing to keep in mind before proceeding is that
the order of the code matters. For instance, when I worked on the code for my cap, I had to place the code 
for my cap after the parts of the face that would intervene with the cap when drawn. If I have not done that 
and placed the code for my cap before the code for my face, then it would have looked like as if the cap is behind 
me and not on me. Therefore, to make it seem as if I am wearing the cap, I had to place the code for my cap
after the code of my face. With this in mind, I tried to make the portrat to look like me by adding details such as 
my piercings and my cap.

This is how my self-portrait looked like:
