**Analog and Digital Snesors in Both Analog and Digital Fashion**

This was third assignment for the course Intro to Interactive Media.
Our professor asked us to get information from at least one analog sensor
and at least one digital sensor (switch), and use this information to control at least two LEDs, 
one in a digital fashion and the other in an analog fashion, in some creative way.

In my work, I have used one analog sensor and two digital sensors. The analog sensor is the potentiometer
and the two digital sensors are the switch toggle and the momentary switch. Each of these sensors have their
own purpose and affects the 3LEDs in various ways. Starting with the switch toggle, the switch toggle turns off
and on the 3LEDs. This means that when the switch toggle is set to off, the momentary switch and potentiometer
won't work. Once the switch toggle is set to on, the momentary switch will allow to user to make the 3LEDs blink 
in a random sequence (only 1 LED will turn on at a time) due to a random number generator. 
While the momentary switch is being pressed and the 3LEDs are blinking, you could play with the potentiometer
to control the brightness of the blinking LEDs.

    Document your work:
        Create a new folder in your github repository called “February18”
        Upload a picture of your circuit schematic.  Your schematic, whether hand drawn or otherwise, must be clear. Remember what a schematic is and is not.
        Upload a photograph of your project
        Create a new file called “description.md” and include:
            A description of your concept and how it was achieved
            Your schematic
            Your photograph
            Problems, if any, and solutions, if any
            Anything else you can think of
        Upload your program. Remember to keep the .ino extension so that it is formatted properly.
