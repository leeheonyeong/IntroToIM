## Black and White Peacock

**Introduction**

For this assignment, our professor asked us to do something creative with an image. The functions that were introduced last
class were:

• tint()

• createImage()

• Brightness

• Filter()

• Capture()

**Process**

First, I thought of an animal or an object that is colorful so the first thing that came to my mind was a peacock. Therefore,
I went on Google and obtained a jpg picture of a peacock and decided to play around with this image. After playing around with 
the functions listed above. I chose to play around with the brightness function and just use the colors black and white.
The result was pretty cool as it gave this image of a peacock that was like hand-drawn with just a pencil. I also added an if
statement to control the threshold of a value that is being compared to the float that gets the brightness of the peacock's 
pixel at a given location with the mouse. This made the art more interactive as the user can control the threshold from just
moving the mouse.

**Challenges and Conclusion**

There was no particular challenge that I faced in this assignment. I actually had an idea in mind which was to use one picture
as the background and put the other picture at the front. Therefore, when the user changes the value of the opacity of the
front picture, it will reveal the background image. However, the result was pretty lame so I decided to just stick to the 
peacock idea. Professor Shiffman's video on Image Processing with Pixels was very helpful as well.
