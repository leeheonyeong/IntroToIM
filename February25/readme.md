**Analog and Digital Sensors in Both Analog and Digital Fashion**

This was fourth assignment for the course Intro to Interactive Media.
Our professor asked us to get information from at least one analog sensor
and at least one digital sensor (switch), and use this information to control at least two LEDs, 
one in a digital fashion and the other in an analog fashion, in some creative way.

In my work, I have used one analog sensor and two digital sensors. The analog sensor is the potentiometer
and the two digital sensors are the switch toggle and the momentary switch. Each of these sensors have their
own purpose and affects the 3LEDs in various ways. Starting with the switch toggle, the switch toggle turns off
and on the 3LEDs. This means that when the switch toggle is set to off, the momentary switch and potentiometer
won't work. Once the switch toggle is set to on, the momentary switch will allow to user to make the 3LEDs blink 
in a random sequence (only 1 LED will turn on at a time) due to a random number generator. 
While the momentary switch is being pressed and the 3LEDs are blinking, you could play with the potentiometer
to control the brightness of the blinking LEDs. 

While making this, I encountered some problems. One of the problems was that I thought my redboard was broken 
since the lights in the redboard weren't lighting up even when I plugged it into my laptop. 
I soon realized that it wasn't lighting up because of the size of the voltage from the breadboards. 
I attempted to use a pressure sensor instead of a potentiometer but realized that a potentiometer works better 
after seeing the pressure sensor in action. Overall, I was also able to achieve this project with the help 
from Professor Shiloh, lab assistants, and Google.
