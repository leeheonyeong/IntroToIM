mention the tambourine problem

This was fourth assignment for the course Intro to Interactive Media.
Our professor asked us to make a musical instrument using at least one servo and tone. 
We were allowed to use other components as well.

In my work, I have used one switch toggle, two momentary switches, one buzzer, one servomotor, and a potentiometer.
First of all, the most important thing is the switch toggle. Without it turned on, the 2 momentary switches won't work
and not play any songs. Therefore, the switch toggle must first be turned on. After that, you ae given the choice to 
press the yellow button or the blue button. The yellow button will play "Old Macdonald Had A Farm" while the blue button 
will play "Mary Had A Little Lamb." After choosing a song, you can play along with the song by controlling the tambourines.
When you feel like you had enough "Karaoke Time", you can turn it off by turning the switch toggle off.

While making this, I encountered some problems. One of the problems was that I thought my redboard was broken 
since the lights in the redboard weren't lighting up even when I plugged it into my laptop. 
I soon realized that it wasn't lighting up because of the size of the voltage from the breadboards. 
I attempted to use a pressure sensor instead of a potentiometer but realized that a potentiometer works better 
after seeing the pressure sensor in action. Overall, I was also able to achieve this project with the help 
from Professor Shiloh, lab assistants, and Google.
