## COVID-19 Data Visualization

**Introduction**

For my final project, I decided to improve on my previous data visualization assignment. As mentioned in the README file that I
created for that assignment, there were some problems that I encountered. One of the problems was that the data from the csv 
file were not accurately presented at the globe. This posed to be a big problem as the main goal of my assignment was to 
display the data correctly. Therefore, I will be fixing this problem, and I will also add some more features such as a main
menu screen and an alternative way to view the data which is to display a bar graph of the number of infected cases in each 
country. This will allow the user to decide how the data should be displayed.
